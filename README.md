# library_borrowing_management_system
This was a summer project during my sophomore year, a Library Borrowing Management System with a visual interface. The system includes two user roles: Administrator and Student.
Students can borrow and return books, as well as search for library information, including book catalogs and available quantities. They can also search for books using keywords and sort the results based on the keywords.
Administrators can manage books and student information, add individual or multiple book entries, and add individual or multiple students.
